The repositoray consists of both the Linux bash script and RStudio assessments

The linux bash scripts provide a functional end to end pipeline in trimming, aligning variant calling and annotation of sequencing data.
Both bash scripts only differ in the alignment utility.
The main assessment script 'm1903050_Adv_Bio_assessment.sh' consists of the Burrows-Wheelers aligner; whereas the script 'm1903050_Adv_Bio_alternative_aligner.sh' consists of the bowtie2 aligner.

The RStudio assessment is stored in the 'RStudio_Assessment' directory. The Markdown.Rmd file produced consists of the whole assessment workflow stored with its .RData, .Rhistory, and .html files.
